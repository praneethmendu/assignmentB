# Front-end assignment

Hi bunq, thank you for this opportunity. Hope you like my code.

##  run app
Run  `ng serve`  for a dev server. Navigate to  `http://localhost:4200/` for the app.

## development
The boiler-plate for this project was generated with the Angular CLI. I also wrote a swapper file for the API that helped with generate the http service and typescript Models.
